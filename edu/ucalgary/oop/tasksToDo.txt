Here is a note area to remind each other what is missing in the project:


1.  We will need a Feeding class for feeding the animals, kit's feeding counts as 
    medical tasks, Feeding should be mostly similar to MedicalTask class. (No longer
    being worked on, someone look into it and see if it's good.)

2. Need to make cage class, all cage cleaning times are 5 mins,
   other than porcupines which take 10 mins. (done)

3. Modify main class

4. GUI??? WIP: need to figure out how to connect inputs from GUI to database

5. put the junit files in lib folder. the two files for testing.
