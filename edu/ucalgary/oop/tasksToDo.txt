Here is a note area to remind each other what is missing in the project:


1.  We will need a Feeding class for feeding the animals, kit's feeding counts as 
    medical tasks, Feeding should be mostly similar to MedicalTask class. (in progress,
     needs commenting as well.)

2. Need to make cage class, all cage cleaning times are 5 mins,
   other than porcupines which take 10 mins.
